# TrackApp Usage

The folder called track hold a python program that when ran will go to the most recent  
meet the UWSP track team was at and display various information in the console about  
who in the throwers has thrown a new personal record and what the old one was, also  
what throw number it was thrown on. This is all relevant information so it is easier  
to make a instagram post for the pointthrows instagram account.

# wholeTrackTeamApp

This is another version of the other python program I am writing to go and get all the teams prs, put them in a formatted file, then go through all the meet results to see if anyone pr'd then display those. Eventually it will be turned into a website, or simple html page to be viewed on a browser that I can host at a later date.
